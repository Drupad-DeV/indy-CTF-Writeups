## Description: 
- Can yu make the output high?

### Solution: 

- On the Attachments Section we can get a PNG image of the logic gates connected and an Simulation Link.
  ** Cannot include the logic gate PNG since it was removed form the webpage **
- The overall challenge was to make the output high and there were 4 inputs.
- So while looking at the characterstics equation there will be 2^4 inputs i.e 16.
- So bruetforced all possible inputs until I got the flag on the LCD screen
