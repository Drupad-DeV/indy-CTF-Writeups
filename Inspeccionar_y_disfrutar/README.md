## Description: 
- N/A

### Solution: 

- The website that came along with the challenge had the flag but was shown as it was blured.

- While Inspecting the website I came to know that even though we remove the Blur styling from the styling the flag was not visible on the webpage
- Then when I inspected each of the sources I could find the flag content in CSS.
