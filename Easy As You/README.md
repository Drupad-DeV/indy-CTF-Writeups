## Description: 
- Could you understand and reverse it? Shouldn't be that tough...

### Solution: 

- On the Attachments Section we can get executeble files for both windows and linux 
- When I did strings I got a wierd string ```ictf{Qm4HvZr1vZk5HqZv5Za4cHc4fpi2}```  
- Then changes the file to executable one and executed it.
- Which prompted me to type in the password where I gave ```Qm4HvZr1vZk5HqZv5Za4cHc4fpi2``` 
- That gave me the Flag.
