## Description: 
- Decrypt the audio to find the flag!!

### Solution: 

- ON hearing the audio I understood that it had a morse code included in it as if the high beeps are 1's and low ones are 0.
- Instead of Decoding it manually I came to know about an online [morse code decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) decoder and used it to decode the flag.
